    "This project uses Python to show various ways that irrational numbers can be approximated based on infinite representations through iterative processes. One thing that I hope this helps to illustrate is the incredible interconnectedness of mathematics. I think it is amazing that the same constants can be relevant in so many contexts and that processes that seem entirely unrelated can produce the same result."

    "## Golden Ratio\n",
    "The golden ratio, denoted ϕ, is an irrational constant equal to $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, or approximately 1.618. For a and b with a > b > 0, a : b is the golden ratio if $\\frac{a+b}{a}=\\frac{a}{b}$ (i.e., small part to large part equals large part to whole). Similarly, only a rectangle with side lengths in the ratio 1 : ϕ can be partitioned into a square and a rectangle similar to the original.\n",

    "The golden ratio shows up in numerous places in nature including flower petals and seed heads and is also frequently encountered in the geometry of pentagons and dodecahedra. Other reasons that the golden ratio is special include that it is the the ratio between adjacent terms in any generalized Fibonacci sequence approach and that it can be represented as a nested radical or continued fraction."

Its value is therefore twice that of π, or about 6.18. τ is relevant in all the same contexts as π; any equation involving π can easily be rewritten to be in terms of τ. The choice of which circle constant to use for any given purpose can be viewed as a matter of personal preference. For this project I have chosen to use τ.\n",
